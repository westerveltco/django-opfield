## [0.1.0]

Initial release! ðŸŽ‰

### Added

-   A custom model field `OPField` for storing references to items in a 1Password vault.
  -   Store a reference to an item in the vault using the `op://` secret reference URI.
  -   Access the secret stored via a `<field_name>_secret` attribute on the model.
  -   Restrict which vaults can be used in the field to a list of vault names, passed in the `vaults` argument to the field.
  -   Explicitly set the name of the secret field in the model, via the `secret_name` argument to the field.
-   A custom `OPURIValidator` class for validating 1Password URIs passed to the field.
-   Initial application configuration options:
  -   `OP_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`: for setting the timeout for `op` commands, defaults to 5 seconds.
  -   `OP_CLI_PATH`: for setting the path to the `op` executable, defaults to using `shutil.which('op')`. If `op` is not found, an exception will be raised.
  -   `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`: for setting the 1Password service account token, defaults to using the value of the `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable. If not set, an exception will be raised.
-   Initial documentation.
-   Initial tests.
-   Initial CI/CD.
